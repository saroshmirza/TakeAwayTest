# Take Away test

The sample project uses the MVVM architecture

## Getting Started

It uses cocoapods, third party libraries that i used are ActionSheetPicker and SwiftyJSON

```
pod install
```

## Overview

Atm i am not saving the favorites into local storage. The logic for sorting on different criterion with saving removing favorites is working fine.
Also for the lack of time i didn't finished the search bar but it should follow the similar MVVM approach.
